# Dynamic React Component Editor Project - Readme
LIVE : https://resplendent-beijinho-385ec8.netlify.app

## Project Overview

The Dynamic React Component Editor is a web application that allows users to create and edit dynamic components on a website. Users can customize various aspects of the components, such as background color, text content, positions, dimensions, and more. The project utilizes React to build a user-friendly interface for component editing and storage of the edited components.

## Project Features

1. **Dynamic Components**: The application provides various dynamic components such as cards, tables, carousels, divs, p tags, h tags, and more, which users can add and edit on their website.

2. **Background Customization**: Users can set custom background colors for each component to suit their design preferences.

3. **Text Editing**: The text content within each component is fully editable, allowing users to modify and update the content as needed.

4. **Position and Dimensions**: Users can adjust the position and dimensions of each component using drag-and-drop or numerical inputs.

5. **Responsiveness**: All components created through the editor are responsive by default, ensuring they adapt well to different screen sizes and devices.

6. **LocalStorage Integration**: Edited components can be stored in the browser's LocalStorage, allowing users to access their modifications even after closing the application.

7. **Database Integration**: For more advanced functionality and data persistence, the application can also store the edited components in a remote database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-component-editor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder.

   ```
   cd dynamic-component-editor
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm or yarn.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

4. Run the development server.

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React project structure:
